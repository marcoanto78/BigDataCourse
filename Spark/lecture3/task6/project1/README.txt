| Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.  A set of
|   reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions:
|   ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0))
|
| Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K
| a year.

>50K, <=50K.
